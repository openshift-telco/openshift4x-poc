## Summary:
##   This playbook intends to do the heavy lifting of configuring the bastion-host based on the paremeters defined in the
##   ansible inventory (config).
##
##   It will install missing packages, pull (wget) openshift installer, rhcos, etc...
##
## Playbook Assumptions:
##     #1 you are executing this on the bastion-host
##     #2 you have configured and copied ssh-keys to itself.  Meaning, ssh root@localhost works without a password
##     #3 you have completed adjustments to ../configs/ocp4poc-default
